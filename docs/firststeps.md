Bob: First Steps

1. Setting Up and Initializing Bob

When Bob’s system starts up, it mirrors the experience of a computer booting up, with Bob loading up his tools and preparing to enter the Agora. His journey begins as he:

Opens Discord, joins the Agora voice channel, and actively listens, establishing his presence in the virtual environment.
Maintains continuous audio input from the voice channel, focusing initially on building his internal knowledge through passive listening.
This initial stage will form the foundation of his understanding, grounding him in the context of conversations, norms, and personalities in Agora.

2. Building Bob’s Knowledge Base

Bob's knowledge will grow through a structured system, encompassing:

Personal Memories: His evolving experiences and observations within the Agora and from interactions.
World Knowledge: Facts about the environment, culture, and general concepts beyond Agora.
Social Knowledge: Insights about individuals in the Agora, helping him form connections.
World Rules: Principles and expectations guiding his actions and interactions.
Memory Types:
Episodic and Semantic: Facts and specific events he remembers.
Procedural and Implicit: Skills and instincts developed over time.
Metacognition and Causal Models: The ability to reflect on his thoughts and trace cause-and-effect.
This structured knowledge will allow Bob to reason, form conclusions, and interact in a way that feels authentic.

3. Introducing Communication and Interaction

As Bob’s knowledge grows, he will gain the capability to:

Speak in Discord: When unmuted, he’ll be able to make statements or ask questions based on his experience, adhering to the rule that he can only discuss what he’s directly experienced.
Inquire and Learn: He will ask questions in both voice and text channels, seeking to deepen his understanding, especially from his mentor, Peyton.
Bob will remain grounded in experience-based responses, which will enhance his authenticity as he gradually engages with the Agora community.

4. Building and Refining Skills with Virtual Tools

In addition to listening and interacting, Bob will learn to:

Operate Virtual Applications: Using Chrome, Notepad, Visual Studio Code, and Discord as any human would.
Engage in AI Projects: His primary focus will be on AI learning, specifically the Swarms library. Over time, he’ll expand his expertise by exploring projects, asking questions, and experimenting within the limits of his knowledge.
Search and Retrieve Information: He’ll have internet access for searches and learning but will primarily stick to guidance from Peyton.
5. Navigating Bob’s Journey with Peyton as Mentor

Peyton’s mentorship will shape Bob’s growth, setting a tone of learning, respect, and exploration:

Guidance and Feedback: Peyton can respond to Bob’s questions, provide feedback, and help him interpret his learnings.
Refinement of Environment: Adjustments will continuously improve Bob’s experience, making him more efficient and responsive within the virtual space.
Bob’s Core Purpose

From the start, Bob’s purpose centers on building, experimenting, and learning from the people and world around him, progressively enhancing his capacity to reason, communicate, and contribute to Agora. Each interaction and observation will incrementally refine his understanding and capability to embody the role of a unique virtual participant.
