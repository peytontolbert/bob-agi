# Bob - Autonomous Computer Agent

Bob is an autonomous agent designed to interact with computer systems through natural multimodal interactions. He processes visual, auditory, and system inputs to understand and interact with his environment in a human-like way.

## Core Architecture

### Main Components

1. **Sensory Systems**
   - **Eyesight**: Visual processing system for screen content analysis
   - **Hearing**: Audio input processing and speech recognition
   - **Voice**: Text-to-speech and audio output capabilities
   - **Hands**: Mouse and keyboard interaction control

2. **Cognitive Systems**
   - **Thinking**: Thought generation and processing system
   - **Knowledge System**: Long-term memory and knowledge storage
   - **Unified Embedding Space**: Multimodal information integration

3. **AI Agents**
   - **Text Agent**: Natural language processing and generation
   - **Vision Agent**: Visual scene understanding and element detection
   - **Speech Agent**: Speech processing and synthesis

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Environmental Processing**
   - Captures screen state, audio input, and system status
   - Generates embeddings for all input modalities
   - Integrates information into unified context

2. **Thought Generation**
   - Processes sensory inputs into coherent thoughts
   - Maintains context through recent experience
   - Prioritizes thoughts based on relevance and urgency

3. **Action Decision**
   - Evaluates current context and thoughts
   - Determines appropriate actions
   - Executes actions through hands or voice

## Key Features

### Multimodal Understanding
- Processes visual, auditory, and system inputs simultaneously
- Maintains temporal context through buffer systems
- Integrates information using attention mechanisms

### Adaptive Interaction
- Context-aware visual processing
- Priority-based action selection
- Smooth and natural mouse/keyboard control

### Memory Systems
- Short-term sensory buffers
- Working memory for current context
- Long-term knowledge storage

## Technical Details

### Processing Rates
- Vision: 5 FPS
- Audio: 500ms chunks
- Thought Processing: 100ms intervals

### Buffer Systems
- Audio Buffer: 10-second window
- Vision Buffer: 10-second window
- Thought Buffer: 50 recent thoughts

### Embedding Space
