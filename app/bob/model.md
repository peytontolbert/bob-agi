# Bob's Cognitive Processing Loop

## 1. Environmental Input Processing
- Visual input (screen state, UI elements)
- Audio input (speech, sounds)
- System state (computer status, running processes)
- Previous action feedback
- Current context and goals

## 2. Multimodal Embedding Integration
- Convert all inputs into compatible embedding vectors
- Combine visual, audio, and system embeddings into unified representation
- Maintain temporal context through embedding sequence
- Apply attention mechanisms to focus on relevant information
- Create coherent scene understanding

## 3. Knowledge Integration
- Query relevant memories from knowledge system
- Access procedural knowledge (how to perform actions)
- Retrieve semantic knowledge (understanding of concepts)
- Apply causal knowledge (understanding cause-effect)
- Integrate spatial knowledge (UI layout understanding)
- Merge episodic memories (past experiences)

## 4. Cognitive Processing
- Generate thoughts based on current context
- Analyze emotional and cognitive state
- Evaluate priority of different stimuli
- Form hypotheses about appropriate actions
- Consider multiple possible outcomes
- Apply reasoning and problem-solving

## 5. Decision Making & Action
- Select highest priority action
- Consider action confidence levels
- Validate action against goals
- Check action feasibility
- Execute chosen action (UI interaction, speech, system command)

## 6. Feedback Processing
- Monitor action results
- Update knowledge system with new experience
- Adjust confidence in decision patterns
- Update emotional/cognitive state
- Modify future behavior based on outcomes

## 7. Loop
- Return to step 1 with updated context
- Maintain continuous processing cycle
- Adjust processing based on urgency/priority

Notes:
- All steps operate in a common embedding space
- Knowledge system is integrated throughout the process
- Feedback influences future iterations
- Processing is continuous and parallel where possible
